## Key Insights

### Cost Trends & Patterns
1. **No Current Spending**: The current month, last month, and year-to-date (YTD) costs are all $0.00, indicating no active spending on GCP services.
2. **No Cost Change**: The 0.0% change in costs from the previous month to the current month reflects stable, non-existent spending.
3. **Untapped Services**: The absence of services listed under "Top Services by Cost" suggests that either no services are being utilized or their costs are negligible.

### Actionable Recommendations
1. **High: Review and Tag Resources**: Tag the 2 untagged Cloud Run resources to improve cost allocation and tracking. This will help in identifying which resources are being used and by whom, enabling better cost management and optimization.
2. **Medium: Investigate Idle Resources**: Examine the 2 idle Cloud Run resources to determine if they can be deleted or optimized. Removing unused resources can help avoid potential future costs and reduce management overhead.
3. **Low: Monitor for New Services**: Regularly review the "Top Services by Cost" section to identify and understand the cost implications of any new services that might be introduced in the future.

### Critical Alerts
* **No immediate critical alerts**: Given the absence of current spending and the relatively minor issues identified (untagged and idle resources), there are no critical alerts requiring immediate attention. However, it's essential to regularly monitor the environment to quickly address any future issues that may arise.
